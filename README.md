A Spotify India Clone! 🎶

Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and powered by the Spotify API, this web app brings the Spotify experience to life! 🎧

✨ Features:

Browse and search for songs, albums, and artists 🎵
Play and pause tracks seamlessly ⏯️
Dynamic and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS 📱💻
Spotify's real-time music data using their official API 🔥
This project gave me a deeper understanding of API integration and styling with Tailwind for responsiveness. Working on the audio player and fetching data from the Spotify API was a fun challenge! 🎨💻
